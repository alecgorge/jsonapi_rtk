#JSONAPI RTK Module
This is a module for JSONAPI and Remote Toolkit by drdanick. This provides a way using a JSONAPI method call (remotetoolkit.startServer) to start a server held by Remote Toolkit. This is so that people using JSONAPI can use JSONAPI to turn their servers on and off.

#Installation
Download [JSONAPI_RTK.jar](https://github.com/alecgorge/jsonapi_rtk/blob/master/jar/JSONAPI_RTK.jar?raw=true) and copy it to your `toolkit/modules/` folder and restart your Remote Toolkit wrapper.
